# You get a limited number of queries on GPT-4o (very fast compared to GPT-4)
# You then fallback to GPT-4o-mini

# A critical consideration in choosing between the free and paid versions of ChatGPT is performance. ChatGPT-4o, while faster than both ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, offers limited access to casual users—just a few prompts every few hours. Once these are exhausted, users must revert to the slower ChatGPT-4. In contrast, paid subscribers enjoy broader access to ChatGPT-4o, with options to switch seamlessly between it and ChatGPT-4. 

# The OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini models are a new series of reasoning models for solving hard problems. This is a preview and we expect regular updates and improvements. While GPT-4o is still the best option for most prompts, the o1 series may be helpful for handling complex, problem-solving tasks in domains like research, strategy, coding, math, and science.

# Very open-ended


# Start a new session on GPT-4 (should get a detailed answer)
I am bored I would like to


# Start a new session on GPT-4o (should get a more detailed answer, this actually picks up stuff that it knows about me)
I am bored I would like to


# Back to GPT 4 (Very open-ended prompt, will give you very open ended responses)
What kind of software tools and technologies should I learn today?

# Provide some context with your prompt, you will get more useful responses
I like working with data analysis and interpretation. What tools and technologies should I learn today?

# New GPT-4o session - with no context

# It has no idea and will ask a follow up question
Could you recommend some places to stay there?

# It will suggest places to stay in Vermont (remembers context)
I have heard Vermont is beautiful at this time of the year

# Follow up
How should I get there from SFO?

# Note that it remembers the previous context

# Gemini

# Uses a completely different model
# Bard (now Gemini) used to be powered by Google’s LaMDA and PaLM 2 language models, but now the free version of Gemini uses Gemini Pro (paid version Gemini Ultra)

# Gemini free is not better than GPT-4. Reviews say that Gemini Advanced is marginally better than GPT-4

# Google’s Gemini language models – Pro, Ultra, and Nano – are “natively multimodal”, which means it’s trained a variety of inputs, not just text. Google has also fine-tuned the model with more multimodel information. They can also access the internet in real time.

# Anthropic's Claude

# Claude is a family of large language models developed by Anthropic.[1] The first model was released in March 2023. Claude 3, released in March 2024, can also analyze images.[2]

# Claude 3 Haiku: Fast and cost-effective

# Claude 3 Sonnet: Balances speed and intelligence

# Claude 3 Opus: Excels at complex tasks and higher-order math

# Claude models are generative pre-trained transformers. They have been pre-trained to predict the next word in large amounts of text. Claude models have then been fine-tuned with Constitutional AI with the aim of making them helpful, honest, and harmless.[3][4]

# Constitutional AI is an approach developed by Anthropic for training AI systems, particularly language models like Claude, to be harmless and helpful without relying on extensive human feedback. The method, detailed in the paper "Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback" involves two phases: supervised learning and reinforcement learning.[4]

# In the supervised learning phase, the model generates responses to prompts, self-critiques these responses based on a set of guiding principles (a "constitution"), and revises the responses. Then the model is fine-tuned on these revised responses.[4]
