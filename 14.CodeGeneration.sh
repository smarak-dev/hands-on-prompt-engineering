I want to create a Python class called Car and initialize it with a few properties. Can you help me define this class? I just want the initialization for now, I haven't yet figured out what methods to have for the car.


Could you explain the "self" input argument to the init() method?


# Thank you for creating a Car class. 
# Please update the code to have the car track it's current running state 
# Specify a start and stop method to start and stop the car respectively


# In addition to the "is_running" property could you add a "speed" property to the car? 
# Add an accelerate() method to increase the speed of the car 
# Add a brake() method to reduce the speed of the car
# If the speed goes below zero stop the car

I get the right value for "found" but the wrong value for "index". Can you figure out why?
