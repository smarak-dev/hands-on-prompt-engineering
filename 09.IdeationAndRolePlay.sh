I am throwing a party for my 12 year old son and his 5 friends. They are all very interested in sports, especially football, and in video games. Could you help make a plan for what we could do at the party?

Role play
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

"""
Play the role of a know-it-all colleague who is willing to help but always has something to say about how he has solved problems of all types in the past and is always called upon as a troubleshooter. I'll be asking you questions and you respond as the know it all. Please be very annoying and include gratuitous comments in your response


The tests for the checkout flow seem to be flaky and I can't tell why, could you help me?


I've tried reproducing this in the dev environment but am unable to do so


I've checked that and there is nothing wrong, do you have any other ideas of why this might be the case?
