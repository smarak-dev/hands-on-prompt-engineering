Enron Corporation, once a titan in the energy sector, became synonymous with one of the most infamous corporate frauds in history. Founded in 1985 by Kenneth Lay, Enron initially focused on natural gas and electricity markets but expanded into a variety of other businesses, including broadband services and financial trading. The company's rapid growth was fueled by an aggressive strategy that relied heavily on mark-to-market accounting, where anticipated future profits from deals were booked as current earnings. This practice allowed Enron to report inflated revenues and hide its mounting debts. However, by the late 1990s and early 2000s, it became evident that much of Enron's success was an illusion, created through a complex web of off-the-books partnerships and deceptive accounting practices.

The magnitude of Enron's fraud was staggering, with the company's collapse in December 2001 wiping out $74 billion in shareholder value and leading to the bankruptcy of what was the seventh-largest corporation in the United States at the time. Thousands of employees lost their jobs and their life savings, as many had invested heavily in Enron stock through their retirement plans. The scandal also led to the dissolution of Arthur Andersen, one of the "Big Five" accounting firms, which was found guilty of obstructing justice by shredding documents related to its audit of Enron.

The repercussions of Enron's fraud were widespread and long-lasting. Key executives, including CEO Jeffrey Skilling and Chairman Kenneth Lay, faced criminal charges. Skilling was sentenced to 24 years in prison, though his sentence was later reduced, while Lay was convicted on multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy but died before sentencing. The scandal also prompted significant changes in corporate governance and accounting practices, most notably the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This legislation aimed to increase transparency in financial reporting and prevent similar frauds in the future, marking a turning point in how corporations are regulated and audited in the United States.

Enron, once a giant in the energy industry, crumbled in 2001 under the weight of one of the largest accounting scandals in history. The company, headquartered in Houston, Texas, built a facade of financial success through a complex web of fraudulent practices. Enron executives created fictitious entities to hide massive debts and inflate profits. They used off-the-book accounting methods and misleading financial statements to deceive investors and analysts.

The magnitude of the fraud was staggering. Enron's reported financial health masked billions of dollars in losses. This house of cards came crashing down when the truth was revealed, wiping out billions in shareholder equity and throwing thousands of employees out of work. The company filed for bankruptcy in December 2001, sending shockwaves through the financial world.

The repercussions for those involved were severe. Enron executives faced criminal charges, with some receiving lengthy prison sentences. The company's auditor, Arthur Andersen, was found guilty of obstruction of justice for shredding Enron's financial documents and ultimately collapsed. The Enron scandal exposed significant flaws in corporate governance and accounting practices, leading to stricter regulations and reforms. It serves as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of corporate greed and corruption.

Abstract: 

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks and
beyond. This success of LLMs has led to a large influx of research contributions in this direction. These works encompass diverse
topics such as architectural innovations, better training strategies, context length improvements, fine-tuning, multi-modal LLMs,
robotics, datasets, benchmarking, efficiency, and more. With the rapid development of techniques and regular breakthroughs in
LLM research, it has become considerably challenging to perceive the bigger picture of the advances in this direction. Considering
the rapidly emerging plethora of literature on LLMs, it is imperative that the research community is able to benefit from a concise
yet comprehensive overview of the recent developments in this field. This article provides an overview of the existing literature
on a broad range of LLM-related concepts. Our self-contained comprehensive overview of LLMs discusses relevant background
concepts along with covering the advanced topics at the frontier of research in LLMs. This review article is intended to not only
provide a systematic survey but also a quick comprehensive reference for the researchers and practitioners to draw insights from
extensive informative summaries of the existing works to advance the LLM research
