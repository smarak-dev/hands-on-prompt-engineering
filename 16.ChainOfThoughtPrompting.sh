Read in two CSV files for employees and salaries. Result should have employees older than 30 years and salary greater than 50000



With customers and orders data can you give me the average order price for each customer who has bought more than $1000 of products?

-------

Using Python and Pandas can you do the following with step by step instructions and code

1. Read employees.csv and salaries.csv into DataFrames df1 and df2, respectively.
2. Filter df1 to include only employees older than 30 years.
3. Filter df2 to include only rows where the salary is greater than 50000.
4. Perform an inner join on df1 and df2 using the employee_id column.
5. Display the resulting DataFrame.

I am planning a new project to build a web server backend for a web application. I am trying to figure out whether it makes sense to use Java or Python for this project

------

Compare Java and Python programming languages keeping the following points in mind and tell me which one would be better for my team to use

1. My team is fairly new and does not have much experience with either programming language

2. Raw data is in CSV files which may need to be parsed and stored in SQL databases

3. Ease of maintenance is more important than performance

4. Prototyping speed is very important

5. Make a final decision based on this criteria
